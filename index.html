        <p class="text-center">Thank you for taking the time to check out my website. If you're looking contant information or anything related to getting in touch with me, head over to the [about page]. Throughout my time as a developer, I have worked on a wide variety of different projects and challenges. If you are interested at all in looking at some of those things that I have done, check them out on the projects page. "I know a significant part of having a portfolio is to show off your projects, but the projects page is a project in-and-of itself and is currently under construction." I also love to write and document my learning process to track and show how I have changed over time, as well as opening up my experiences to help teach others. If you;re interested in any of the things I have to say, check out my pieces in the [writings] section.</p>
