            <p>Truth be told; I have always struggled to talk about myself. But you would not have come to my about page if you weren't looking to learn a little more about me. My name is Evan Yohe, I am twenty-four and I live in the greater Seattle area. In my spare time, I like to play music with my friends. I also love to woodwork and enjoy making instruments as much as I like to play them. Along with traditional woodworking, I also build my own analog guitar amplifiers as well to round out my instrument making skills. I grew up with a fierce love of videogame and gaming in general. I have lived in the pacific northwest for the entirety of my life.</p>
            <p>When I was twelve years old I made my first forray into the world of computer programming when I decided I needed to make a small addon for a videogame. After the struggle of making a simple game addon, I graduated into trying to learn different programming languages. Like everyone else, I made my rounds through C, C++, python, javascript, you name it! After trying a ton of different programming languages with no real idea about their differences, I decided to take the first every AP computer science class offered at my school. They chose to teach us java. After graduating highschool and beginning to work, I chose to maintain my practical skills and leave programming as a side hobby I could pull out when I needed to. As you can imagine, over the five or so years since I graduated highschool, making one website didn't really maintain my skills as well as I had hoped.</p>
            <p>A few months ago, after clocking off from working at a grocery store all day, I exclaimed to myself that I was done with physical labor and inconsistent shift schedules. I knew that I had a skillset that was long dormant, but I felt the need to call on it again to break the schackles of my old life. I chose to refresh my skills and work towards becoming a full time software developer. My initial goal was to become a data scientist, but that plan was quickly waylayed by my general distaste for high level programming languages. After revisiting a massive number of programming language I had tried in the past, and all the programming languages that I written off previously, I almost gave up after finding it hard to relearn the basics of programming.</p>
            <p>And then I found it. It. The capital It. Rust. The savior of low level programming languages. I beacon of hope, cutting through the night sky to show that systems level programming is still important to some of us. Finally I had found a worthy contender to challenge C and C++ as the de-facto low level language. I had fallen in love and I knew that once I had started programming in rust, I would never go back again.</p>
            <p>Talk about my dogs and cats a little bit. Background of the projects I've worked on recently.</p>
