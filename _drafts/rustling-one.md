# Rustlings Practice: Introductions

Hello everyone and thank you for checking out this first introductionary piece I am writing as I work through my rustlings exercises. I have always found that for myself personally, taking notes and recording things as I do them helps by reinforcing the learning at the time of learning, while also allowing for return to the material in a way that is already organized and presented in a way I can understand it. I cannot with any certainty say that reading about the mistakes and solutions I find as I do these problems will help you do whatever it is you want to, but I know that it will at least help me.

## How These Writings Will Work

I plan to do up to two rustlings problem a day, but never less than one per day.
Every time I open my terminal to start a rustlings exercises, I will also make a new post to record all of my progress.
Throughout the day as I work on my rustlings exercises, I'll take screenshots and save code snippets in my posts and document my journey as I solve whatever problem I happen to be working on that day.

## Why I Chose To Write About These Exercises

I already mentioned above that one of the main reasons for my writing about these exercises is to show how I solve problems; but more importantly these writings are to show the evolution over time in my thinking and the approach I take to solving a problem.

The idea behind the rustlings exercises is to get people reading and writing rust code from a mindset that embraces the strengths that rust has to offer the programming community, without overwhelming people with the nitty gritty details of a systems programming language. Rustlings exercises are not meant to be a comprehensive tutorial that teaches you rust and treating them as such will diminish the value they can have. In reality, the rustlings courses are a companion to your own learning in rust that will help you become more comfortable in the rust environment. If we think of learning rust as stacking block on top of another, these exercises will act as small checks to make sure your foundation is secure before adding more blocks on top. In our analogy, if we were to add more rust knowledge on top of an unstable foundation, you risk having gaps in your knowledge that can prevent you from learning different things down the line.

## Before I begin...

One last note before I create another file and start working on our very first rustlings exercise: Participation is important. The difference between attempting to do these exercises on your own, and reading the answer online is insurmountable. The act of attempting to do the exercise first before looking up a solution can have profound effects, not on how you learn the material, but your perspective and mindset as you approach learning the material now and in the future. To sum it up really quickly: try first on your own, try your best, and if you still don't get it then follow along with me.
