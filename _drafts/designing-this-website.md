The chances are that if you're reading this post, you have at one point already built or tried to build your own website. If you are not part the the afformentioned group, don't panic! There is still plenty of information to be had here for the professional and novice alike.

Web Design is a topic that has been beaten to death like a dead horse. A cursory index of google shows that their are , INSERT STATISTIC AND CITATION HERE , web pages that mention the name web design in either the title or subtitle. The internet is growing at an unprecidented rate that makes it humanities most revolutionary invention since the wheel. So with such a massive focus on the structure and backbone of the internet, anyone looking to hire a programmer, software developer, or coder would be a fool not to make sure they have at least a cursory knowledge of the basic structure of the internet. Without wasting anymore of your time, let me get off my soapbox and show you how I designed, built, destroyed, and rebuilt the very portfolio you are looking at now.
