## Introduction

I have always found that by making notes, written or typed, significantly helps with my retention of the material. So without further ado, for your benefit as much as my own, feel free to read over all the personal notes I have made on the Rust programming language since I have recently started working with it.

### Basic Rust Syntax

Rust is a language that is very similar to other low level languages like, C, C++, Java, amongst many others. If you are familiar with the traditional syntax that you will find in a low level language than the transition to Rust will be fairly easy. Some quick things to highlight very quickly.

### The Path We'll follow

As I was learning how to write and read Rust code from all the various sources I could find I had the itching suspicion in the back of my mind that it would be easier to learn this skill if the information were presented in a more logical and linear fashion. As I went about my learning and my writing code, I started to pull all these various soruces of information into one spot so I could create an easy reference that I would be able to refer to until the skills had sunk in properly.

One of the reasons why I felt the need to rewrite the notes and learning material for a language that everyone has been calling finished for years now is because I feel there is a significant shift in the perspective of writing Rust code from that of another programming language that should be conveyed in the learning materials that shows us how to write Rust code

### Shifting Perspective and How To Write Like a Rust Coder

Truth be told; writing code in rust is no different than any other programming language out there. But this isn't my "Learn the Computer Science Fundamentals" blog post. Adapting a different percpective and point of view when you encounter a new tool or set of problems can often times help you learn more quickly. It is a fairly famous quote by INSERT-PERSON-HERE
