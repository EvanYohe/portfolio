## Introduction

I have always found that by making notes, written or typed, significantly helps with my retention of the material. So without further ado, for your benefit as much as my own, feel free to read over all the personal notes I have made on the Rust programming language since I have recently started working with it.

### Basic Rust Syntax

Rust is a language that is very similar to other low level languages like, C, C++, Java, amongst many others. If you are familiar with the traditional syntax that you will find in a low level language than the transition to Rust will be fairly easy. Some quick things to highlight very quickly are:

```rust
fn main(){
    println!("Hello {}", "world");
}

for(int i; i<100, i++){

​	if(java != rust){

​	print rust is better
    }
​}
```
